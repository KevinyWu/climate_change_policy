In this paper, we will analyze global land surface temperature data from Berkeley
Earth going back to 1850 to model the rate of climate change in the post-Industrial
Revolution era. There is a general scientific consensus that in this era, climate
change has significantly increased compared to past trends; however, whether this
trend has continued on into the 21st century remains up for debate. This paper uses
time-series techniques, particularly ARMA modeling and detrending techniques, to
make conclusions about whether or not global climate policies beginning with the
Kyoto Protocol have caused a statistically significant change in the rate at which
global temperatures have risen over the 21st century.

This was a project for SOSC 13300, done with my partner Matthew Chen. Presentations of our findings can be found in this [folder](https://github.com/KevinyWu/climate_change_policy/tree/main/presentations). Findings are summarized in the paper, [The_Impacts_of_International_Climate_Policies_on_Global_Temperature.pdf](https://github.com/KevinyWu/climate_change_policy/blob/main/The_Impacts_of_International_Climate_Policies_on_Global_Temperature.pdf).
